Help WooCommerce stores boost sales with 10+ powerful marketing & sales tools like social proof, coupon popups, upsell popups, email popups, sales notification.

=== Description ===

Beeketing is a complete marketing solution for WooCommerce online stores of all shapes and sizes. The plugin contains many marketing and selling tools that you’ll ever need to optimize your sales funnel and boost sales.


== FEATURES ==

= Gain trust from first-time visitors =

1. Sales notifications: generate and show notifications of real (or custom) orders in the form of small corner popups on your site to gain trust from first-time visitors.

2. Social proofs: embed a popup that shows the numbers of people who have viewed & have added to cart a specific product to create the crowd effect.

= Increase conversion rate =

3. Sticky add-to-cart button: implement an extra add-to-cart button on the mobile screen so customers can add cart anytime without scrolling all the way up and down.

4. Sales countdown timer: place a countdown clock on product pages to show how much time is left before your sale ends. It would create a sense of urgency and motivate customers to buy within a limited time.

5. Low-stock indicator: display how many items left to urge customers to buy before the product is out of stock.

6. Coupon popups: trigger a coupon/free gift popup when customers meet your pre-set conditions. The condition can be a cart value threshold, specific products in cart, etc. The popup will motivate customers to spend more, and help you prevent cart abandonment. You can just give away the coupon or ask for a social share in return.
   **Special feature**: attach a countdown clock to your coupon popup to urge customers to checkout within a limited time.

= Upsell & Cross-sell =

7. Upsell popups: increase order value by recommending customers to replace their items in cart by higher-end items. The upsell popups can be triggered when customers click Add-to-cart button or Checkout button.

8. Gamification progress bar: make online shopping a fun game where customers can win a coupon if they reach your cart value goal. This feature goes with the upsell popups to motivate customers to buy from your upsell popups.

9. Product bundles: combine complementary products into bundles and place them at product pages to cross-sell multiple items at a time. You can also display your product bundles in the form of popups.

10. Product slider: showcase different product sliders (Best Sellers, Recently Viewed, Who Bought This Also Bought, Recommendations Based on Cart) at each page to suggest relevant items to what customers are currently viewing.

= Build a long-term relationship with customers and get more repeat purchases =

11. Post-purchase coupon popups: offer a coupon when an order is completed to encourage repeat purchases. The popup will appear at Thank you page after customers complete checkout.

12. Facebook live chat: embed a live chat widget to your WooCommerce store to talk to your customers in real time via Facebook Messenger.

13. Email popups: collect emails or social subscribers with a welcome popup when customers first land in your site.

14. Email automation: recover abandoned carts and engage with your customers with pre-built email campaigns: Happy Email, Cart Abandonment, Buy Again, Win-back Emails, etc.

15. Custom Newsletter: send new arrivals emails or weekly newsletters easily using the drag and drop template builder.
