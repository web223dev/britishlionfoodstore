Display your happy customers' Testimonials in a neat Responsive Slider 

== Description ==

Testimonial Slider shows the testimonials and feedbacks submitted by your Happy Customers in a clean, responsive and beautiful Slider format. The "Testimonials" are a Custom Post Type so it is very easy to add, modify and delete testimonials. You can enter the Customer's Image/Avatar, Name, Company, Website in the Custom Fields for the Testimonial and the actual Testimonial text in the "Description". It is as simple as that!

= Important notice about this plugin's maintainership and future =

This plugin is (October 2018) under new maintainership. The previous maintainer (whom we sincerely thank for his work) was no longer working on it. Security issues had been discovered, and not fixed, and the wordpress.org repository had closed the plugin. We have taken over maintainership *solely for the purposes of keeping the plugin alive* (since we were using it on our own live sites) and secure. No future feature developments are planned, though, you are welcome to send in new code for us to evaluate for inclusion if you are interested yourself. As such, we *do not particularly recommend* using this plugin on new sites, as it has no planned future of new features, only of being kept alive. Accordingly, whilst users are of course welcome and encouraged to support eachother in the wordpress.org forums, we will be quite likely to pass over anything found there except significant bug reports.
