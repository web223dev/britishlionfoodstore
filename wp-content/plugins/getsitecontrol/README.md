- **Behavior settings**: full control over the widget's behavior - choose when to start and stop to display the widget and how often your site visitors should see it.
- **Exit popups**: stop visitors from leaving your site with a message shown just before they exit: offer a discount, invite to subscribe, complete a survey or like your page.
- **Custom images**: choose an image from our extensive gallery or upload your own.
- **Google Analytics** integration
- **URL targeting**: display the widgets site-wide or choose the pages on which the widgets should appear. Target specific URLs or groups of URLs, include or exclude certain pages.
- **Thank You page**: add a custom final message to thank your site visitors for subscribing, taking a survey or submitting feedback and encourage further action.
- **Automatic color matching**: choose from automatically generated color schemes matching your website colors. Or select a base color and we will match colors for all widget elements.
- **Advanced color customization**: design your own unique widgets that will perfectly match your company colors: choose custom colors for the background, header, text and buttons.
- **Advanced targeting**: choose who should see each widget: target visitors by country, device, browser, OS, traffic source, IP or UTM parameters. Select one parameter or combine several ones to personalize widget content for different groups of visitors.
- **A/B testing**: create several versions of the same widget and let your website visitors determine the winner to find out what colors, layout, texts and call-to-actions work best.
- **Autoresponder**: create custom messages that will be automatically sent to those who have subscribed to your newsletter, completed a survey or used your contact form.
