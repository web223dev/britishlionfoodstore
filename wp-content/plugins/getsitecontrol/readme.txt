**CORE FEATURES**


- **On-page behavior triggers**: display popups based on how long a visitor has spent on a webpage, how much they have scrolled down, or other custom action-based parameters.
- **Audience targeting**: choose who should see each widget. Target visitors by their language, location, device, browser, OS, traffic source, IP or UTM parameters. Create personalized messages by combining several parameters for different audiences.
- **Exit-intent technology**: show popups right before a visitor abandons a webpage. Use this feature to offer a special last-minute deal or display a website exit survey.
- **Integrations**: connect GetSiteControl to any email marketing app, Google Analytics, Slack, and Zapier.
- **Autoresponder** – send automated emails to those who subscribe to your newsletter, interact with a contact form, or fill out a survey.
- **9 webpage positions for each widget**: decide whether a widget should appear as a modal popup, a floating bar at the top or the bottom of a page, a slide-in, a side button, or a tab.
- **Widget customization**: make use of the image gallery, custom fields, and color themes matching your website - or build and design a new form from scratch using your own copy and creative.
- **Mobile responsiveness** – have your popups automatically adjusted to smaller screens to maintain great user experience and comply with Google requirements.
- **A/B testing** – create up to 5 variations of the same widget and run a split test to find out which copy, creative, and call-to-action brings you higher ROI.
- **Real-time statistics** – analyze widget performance right in the app dashboard using easy-to-read graphs and reports generated in real-time.
